This is the code to solve [**gym-game2048**](https://github.com/helpingstar/gym-game2048), a reinforcement learning environment based on the 2048 game.

After training, you can modify the `weight_path` in the `monitoring.py` file to record the agent's gameplay.

The parameters for training are inside the `game2048_v2_ppo*.py` file and can be modified as desired.
